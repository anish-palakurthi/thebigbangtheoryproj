However Sheldon already promised Amy that he would attend her Aunt Flora's 93rd birthday party and meet her family during the weekend and reluctantly decides not to take part in the marathon, but still tries to convince Penny to make Amy change her mind, to no avail. Sheldon eventually decides to go with Amy, but also brings his laptop so that he can play with the guys remotely.

When Sheldon finds out, he is unhappy: his assistant Alex should devote her time to him.

A newly confident Amy goes back to Human Resources to be allowed to campaign again and shares a drink with Davis. Meanwhile, Howard buys a scooter to ride with Raj like in the old days. Bernadette finds out and makes him sell it, since it is too dangerous. Bert buys it and ends up meeting a nurse after he dislocates his arm in a wreck.

    "plot": "When Penny tells Leonard he needs to be more assertive in making decisions for himself, he starts standing up to Sheldon over small things. His confidence makes him demand that the university support his idea for a plasma physics project. He threatens to quit if the university refuses, alarming both Sheldon and Penny, who consider this to be a risky career move. Sheldon is conflicted on whether or not he is being selfish over Leonard's decision, but Amy suggests that the fact that he is worried over Leonard's motivation proves that he does care about him, which he acknowledges. President Siebert refuses the project but, in order not to lose Leonard, gives him co-leadership over a photon entanglement project, leaving Leonard proud of himself and Penny impressed. Meanwhile, Raj shows Anu his lab and suggests one possible answer for something he has seen in space might be alien life. When someone mentions this at his observatory presentation, the scientific community starts mocking him as a conspiracy theorist. Raj points out scientists should consider all possibilities when seeking the truth, though this causes people to think he believes in the Loch Ness Monster.

    "plot": "After Sheldon and Leonard spend two months repairing Sheldon's DNA molecule model, everyone prepares to fly to Sweden for the Nobel Prize award ceremony. Howard and Bernadette nervously leave their kids for the first time with Stuart and Denise, while Raj leaves his dog with Bert. Penny has become pregnant, though she and Leonard are keeping it a secret. On the flight, Raj meets Sarah Michelle Gellar. Penny's frequent bathroom trips make Sheldon fear she is sick. Penny reveals her pregnancy to Sheldon but, instead of being excited for her, Sheldon is only selfishly relieved that he will not get sick, and he exposes the pregnancy, offending Leonard. At the hotel, a series of minor incidents with their kids make Howard and Bernadette want to go home. Much to their dismay, Sheldon is still insensitive. Amy furiously tells Sheldon he broke his friends' hearts and that people (sometimes including her) only tolerate him because he does not intentionally do so. Everyone decides to stay for the ceremony and Raj brings Gellar as a plus-one. After they are awarded their medals, Amy encourages girls to pursue science while Sheldon thanks his family and then, discarding the acceptance speech that he wrote as a child, individually acknowledges each of his friends and Amy as his other family who always support him, apologizing to all of them for not being the friend they deserved. In the last scene in the episode and the series, the gang is eating in Apartment 4A (an allusion to the final scene in the opening credits) with Sheldon and Amy wearing their medals as a melancholic acoustic version of the series' theme song's chorus plays. Title reference: Sheldon thinking Penny is ill on the flight to Stockholm; a reference to Stockholm syndrome."
