Project will aim to recommend a user with other episodes of the same show that they might like based on an episode that they enjoyed.
Works best for shows with a lot of episodes with contained plots.

Uses scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer to vectorize the text of each episode's plot summary or scripts, clusters via K-means, 
and then uses cosine similarity to find the most similar episodes based on said clusters.
