There generally accepted pattern this area, I would pick up, take to restaurant, we would a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring talents Hugh Grant Sandra Bullock.  Interesting. And would agree primary way would evaluate either the success failure the date would based the bio-chemical reaction the goodnight kiss. Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes.  Well, don’t just stipulate the date goes well move the key variable. You mean, kiss now? Yes.  Can define parameters the kiss? Closed mouth romantic. Mint? Thank you. (Takes mint). Shall I count from three? No, I think needs be spontaneous. What you think. You proposed experiment, I think should present findings first. Fair enough. On plus side, was good kiss, reasonable technique, extraneous spittle. On other hand, arousal.  None? None. Ah. Well, thank for time. Thank you.  None all? and Leonard’s flat. Sheldon, and are playing Jenga.  Sheldon, a robot, I knew you didn’t, would you want to you? That depends. When I learn I’m robot, I able handle it? Maybe, although history science-fiction not your side.  Uh, me ask this. When I learn I’m robot, would I bound Asimov’s three laws robotics? You might bound them right now. That’s true. Have ever harmed human being, through inaction allowed human to to harm? Of course not.  Have ever harmed yourself, allowed to harmed except cases a human would been endangered? Well, no. I smell robot.  Hey, what’s going on. The internet’s down half hour.  Also, may a robot.  So, did go Lesley?  Oh, tried kissing, the earth didn’t move. I mean more the 383 miles it going move anyway.  Oh, I’ve seen look before. This just going be two weeks moping tedious emo songs, calling down pet stores to look cats. I don’t if I take it.  You could power down. Well, usual, has solution. I happen know place there plenty eligible women, Leonard could his pick. A salsa class. The four guys a random fat bloke salsa opposite five middle-aged women. Remember Latin hips. Shoulders stay still, we sway. One two three. Five six seven.  I think Mrs Tishman’s got eye you. I’ve there, you’re for treat.  The flat, is entering, singing himself depressing emo song. Oh, good lord. You don’t me, don’t wear chains… God, that’s good song.  If you’re compiling mix CD double suicide. (Leonard taking supplies of a bag) Oh, I hope scratching post for you. I what you’re thinking, I’ve taken asthma account. There’s feline geneticist San Diego has developed cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos.  Leonard, listen me… I’ve thinking names, I’m kind torn Einstein, Newton Sergeant Fuzzyboots.  Leonard, think you can satisfy need a relationship a genetically altered cat? Maybe, it’s cute little cuddly cat. Oh, on, Leonard! This obviously Penny.  It doesn’t matter. The woman’s interested me, woman rejected me.  Okay, look, I think much chance having a sexual relationship Penny as the Hubble Telescope discovering the centre of every black hole a little man a flashlight searching a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I feel obligated point to you that reject you. You did not ask out.  You’re right. I didn’t ask out, I ask out. No. No, that not point. My point was, don’t buy cat.  No, you’re right. I march there ask out.  Oh, goody, we’re getting cat.  The hallway. knocks Penny’s door.  Ah, hey Leonard. Good afternoon Penny, hi, hey. Uh… I wondering you plans dinner. Uh, you mean dinner tonight? There an inherent ambiguity the word dinner. Technically refers the largest meal the day whenever is consumed, so, clarify here, dinner I mean supper. Supper? Or dinner. I thinking six thirty, you go, a different time. Uh, six thirty’s great. Really? Great! Yeah, I like hanging with guys. Us guys? You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, all’s coming? They…. might there. Or subset them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking are many unknowns, example had Quizznos lunch, sometimes finds filling, times doesn’t, it’s fault Quizznos, have varied menu. Okay, whatever, sounds like fun. Great. Did say time? Six thirty. And that’s still good you. It’s fine. Cos it’s carved stone. No, six thirty’s great. I’ll my chisel. Why? To… carve the… okay, I’ll you six thirty. Leonard’s apartment. enters bedrooms, dressed a smart shirt and trousers. They covered sweat stains. How I look? Could be specific? Can tell I’m perspiring little? No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns your arms conceal nicely. What time your date? Six thirty.  Perfect, gives two hours fifteen minutes that dense molecular cloud Aramis dissipate.  Is too much? Not you’re rugby team.  By way, it ever up, didn’t join us you stuffed with chicken carbonara sub Quizznos.  Why would I join you? No reason. Oh, know what, maybe isn’t a good idea.  Oh, no, no, no, well now, there’s always possibility alcohol poor judgement her part might lead a nice romantic evening. You’re right, alcohol, poor judgement, could well. Of course, there’s other possibility this date kicks a rather unpleasant six months the two you passing awkwardly the hall one you breaks and moves another zip code. You could stopped “it could well.” If I could of, I would of.  I mean, I’m perfectly nice guy. There’s reason couldn’t restaurant have lovely dinner. Maybe take walk afterwards, about things have common, “you love pottery? I love pottery!” You know, there’s pause, both what’s happening, I lean in, kiss, it’s little tentative first then I realise, she’s kissing back, she’s biting lower lip, know, wants me, thing going distance, we’re going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, God! Is sex starting now? I’m a panic attack. Oh, okay, well then, calm down. If I could calm I wouldn’t having panic attack, that’s they call a panic attack. Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, close eyes. Why? Just it. Okay. Now try increase alpha-wave activity. What? It’s bio-feedback technique, it’s relaxation brain-wave manipulation, I read paper Journal American Neuroscience, it was little sparsely sourced I think the basic science valid, I probably it somewhere. Oh, am I kidding, I can’t through this, need call and cancel. Me? Yes. What I her. I don’t know. Tell I’m sick. Okay. Not kind illness will her to over take care me, nothing critical she’ll feel uncomfortable going with in future I to try again. Got it. So I’m assuming nothing venereal. I’ll tell that had routine colonoscopy haven’t quite bounced back. Give the phone.  But I thought wanted cancel? I can’t if I don’t show she’ll still expecting you. Why would be expecting me?  Stop asking all questions, I to take another shower. A restaurant. So the rest the guys meeting us here? Oh, yeah, no. Turns that work, Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn’t quite bounced back yet.  Ooh, uncle had colonoscopy. You’re kidding, well, then, that’s something have common.  How? We have people our lives who… to nip intestinal polyps the bud.  So, what’s new the world physics? Nothing. Really, nothing? Well, exception string theory, much happened since the 1930’s, can’t prove string theory, best you can “hey, look, idea an internal logical consistency.” Ah. Well I’m sure things pick up.  What’s new the Cheesecake Factory? Oh, uh, much. We have chocolate key lime that’s moving pretty well.  Good. Good. And about your, uh, hallway friend. Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, he’s nice funny, but… Can I you started some drinks? No, (waves away) You saying, but… I’d like drink. Just the thing Doug then I’ll her back.  Okay, well, know, it’s me. I’m still getting this break-up Kurt, this with Doug would just rebound sex. Ugh, don’t me started rebound sex. It’s just, it’s pattern. I break up, I find cute guy, then it’s thirty six meaningless of… well, know.  I’m sure I do. Um, that one thirty-six hour experience, is thirty six hours spread over say, one… glorious summer. No, it’s usually a weekend, trust me, do feel good it. Well, chafing, right? Emotionally. Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, you to something cool? (Penny nods.) I make olive into glass without touching it.  How? Physics. (He places glass olive spins until olive gets caught on the side). Wow, centrifugal force! Actually, it’s centripetal force, is inward force generated the glass acting the olive. (The olive drops.) Excuse me. (Leonard disappears table.)Now, you riding the olive, you’d in non-inertial reference frame, would (he bangs head the underside the table.) Are okay? Yeah, I’m okay. Did spill ketchup? No. I’m okay. The stairwell the apartment building. Are sure don’t to to emergency room? No, no, I’m okay, it’s stopped bleeding. I know, you throw up. Isn’t a sign a concussion? Yes, I car sick too, so… Okay. Sorry your car, the way. Oh, no, it’s fine, got of out window.  The poor on bike. I a nice time. Yeah, too. Um, good night. (Leonard turns across hallway.) Leonard? Yeah. Was supposed be date? This? No. No, course not, was you me hanging with bunch guys didn’t show up, of and colonoscopy. Okay, I just checking. When I take girl on date, I do, knows she’s dated. Capital D.

Anyway, occurs me, I ever perfect time machine, I’d go past give myself, thus eliminating need me to invent in the first place. Interesting. Yeah, really takes pressure off.  Sounds like breakthrough, I call science magazines tell to hold front cover? (Exiting apartment.) It’s time travel, Leonard, I have already done that.  Then I guess congratulations in order. No, congratulations have in order. You know, I’m going enjoy party. I know, I’m familiar you. At last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered and talked spelunking 45 minutes. Yes, I there.

(Puts arm around her.) I already told you, touching’s extra. Right. Sorry. Here comes new boss, polite. Hi fellas, Eric Gablehouser. Wolowitz. Howard, nice meet you, you are? An actual real scientist. (To Leonard) How that? The stairwell the apartment building. is carrying box his things. I can’t believe fired me. Well, did call a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment lighting own farts. In defence, I prefaced by saying “with due respect.” The apartment, is the kitchen cooking, enters. Morning Morning. You’re making eggs breakfast? This isn’t breakfast, it’s experiment.  Huh? Cos looks lot like breakfast. I finally the time test hypothesis, the separation the water molecules the egg proteins, its impact vis-a-vis taste. Sounds yummy. I forward your with bacon. As I. You know, I’m sure apologised Gablehauser would give you your job back. I don’t my job back. I’ve spent last three a half years staring greaseboards full equations. Before I spent four years working my thesis. Before I in college, before that, I in fifth grade. This my first day in decades, I’m going savour it. Okay. I’ll you back fixing eggs. I’m just fixing eggs, I’m fixing everyone’s eggs. And all thank you. Use new eggs. (There a on door). Hi, hey. I’m running to market, you guys anything?

I’m taking sabbatical, I won’t kow-tow mediocre minds.  So got canned, huh? Theoretical physicists not canned. But yeah.  Well, maybe it’s for best, know I always say, one door closes, another one opens.  No doesn’t. Not unless two doors connected relays, there motion sensors involved.  No, no, I meant… Or first door closing causes change air pressure acts upon second door. Never mind.  Slow down. Slow down, please slow down. We’re fine. Look, you’re leaving enough space cars. Oh, sure I am. No, no. Let do math you, car weighs let’s 4,000lb, add 140 me, 120 you. 120? Oh, I’m sorry, I insult you? Is body mass somehow tied your self worth? Well, yeah. Interesting. Anyway, gives us total weight of, let’s say, 4,400lb. Let’s 4,390.  Fine. We’re travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles hour.

There a lot advantages buying bulk. For example, I noticed you purchase tampons one month’s supply a time. What? Well think it, it’s product doesn’t spoil, you’re going be needing for least next thirty years. You me buy thirty years worth tampons? Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, did mother into menopause? Okay, I’m talking this you. Oh, Penny, is natural human process, we’re talking statistically significant savings. Now, you assume 15 tampons per cycle a 28 day cycle, you fairly regular? (Penny shuts door his face.) Okay, warehouse store, we’re still for put-put golf, right? The apartment, has several bowls containing goldfish.  Hey, I ran Penny, seemed upset something. I think it’s time month. I marked the calendar future reference.  What’s the fish? It’s experiment.  What happened your scrambled egg research? Oh, was dead end. Scrambled eggs good as they’re ever going be. So… fish.  I read article Japanese scientists, inserted DNA luminous jellyfish other animals, I thought hey, fish nightlights. Fish nightlights. It’s billion dollar idea. Shhhhh! Mum’s word. Sheldon, sure you don’t apologise to Gablehauser get job back. Oh, no, no, no. No, I’ve much do. Like luminous fish. Shhhhh! Right… I didn’t….

Gentlemen, I now send signal this laptop our local ISP, racing fibre-optic cable speed light San Francisco, bouncing a satellite geosynchronous orbit Lisbon, Portugal, the data packets be handed submerged transatlantic cables terminating Halifax, Nova-Scotia, transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP the X10 receiver attached to this (clicks mouse, lamp switches on) lamp. (The others cheer clap).  Look me, at me, I’ve got goosebumps.  Are ready the stereo?  Go stereo.  Hey guys.  Hello. It’s little loud. No problem, turning down. (Using mouse again) San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax (the music gets quieter) et voila.  Okay, thanks. Hang on, hang on, you realise we did. Yeah, turned stereo with laptop.  No, turned stereo by sending signal around world via internet.  Oh. You you just one those universal remotes Radio Shack, they’re cheap. No, no, no, don’t it, um, Howard, enable public access.  Public access enabled. (They stare around a moment silence.) Boy, that’s brilliant, I’ll you. No, hang on, hang on. (The lamp goes and again.) See!  No. Someone Sezchuan province, China using computer turn lights and off.  Huh, well that’s handy. Um, here’s question, why?  Because can. (There a loud noise) They found remote controlled cars. Well, wait, wait, what’s top them.  Wireless webcams, wave hello.  The monster truck out Austin, Texas, the blue Viper being operated suburban Tel Aviv.  You may to put slacks.  What? (Seeing red car trying get her legs) Ew, stop it, no, leave alone.  Who’s running red Corvette? That would me.  The same, clearing up. You know, the future, we’re disembodied brains jars, we’re going look back this eight hours well wasted.  I don’t to jar. I my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall ripped.  I’m you. I have make sure I’m synthetic human I’d still Jewish. I promised mother.  I suppose could android penis circumcised. But that’s something your Rabbi would to discuss the manufacturers.  Not mention you’d to power on Saturdays.  Sheldon, is letter the trash?  Well, there’s always possibility a trash spontaneously formed around letter, Occam’s Razor would suggest someone threw out.  It’s the Institute Experimental Physics. They us present paper the properties super solids the topical conference Bowes-Einstein condensates.  I know. I read before I threw out.  Okay… I may drill to bedrock my question, did throw out. Because I no interest standing the Rose Room the Pasadena Marriott front group judgemental strangers, wouldn’t recognise true genius standing front them giving a speech. Which, I there, it would be.  I don’t know, Sheldon, topical conferences Bowes-Einstein condensates parties legendary.  Forget parties. Forget parties? What nerd.  Are any honours I’ve gotten I don’t about? Did UPS drop a Nobel Prize my name it? Leonard, please don’t take the wrong way, the day win Nobel Prize, the day I begin research the drag co-efficient tassles flying carpets.  Hoo-hoo-hoo. The thing missing that insult “yo mamma.”  I’ve got one, hey Leonard, mamma’s research methodology so flawed…. Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, have do this. No don’t. We take nourishment, expel waste, inhale enough oxygen to keep from dying, everything else optional.  Okay, me put this way, I’m it. You can’t. I’m lead author.  Oh, on. The reason you’re lead author because went alphabetically.  I think went alphabetically spare the humiliation dealing the fact it my idea. Not put fine point it, I throwing you a bone. You’re welcome.  Excuse me, I designed experiment proved hypothesis.  It doesn’t proving.  So entire scientific community just supposed take word? They’re supposed to, they should.  Alright, I don’t care you say, I’m going the conference I’m presenting findings.  And I forbid it.  You forbid it? If I’m taking credit our then nobody is.  Oh, admit it’s work. No, again, I’m throwing a bone. And again, are welcome.  Ah! Oh he dit’nt! Leonard’s bedroom. is looking his closet.  So, how’s going Sheldon, you guys still talking each other?  Not is still talking me, there’s thing does he stares you tries get brain explode. You know, like the classic sci-fi movie Scanners? (Put’s fingers head) You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How this one. It says, “I my physics, I’m still fun guy!” Oh, hey, I didn’t they still made corduroy suits! They don’t, that’s I saved one.  Okay, well, let’s see else have. Okay, here, take this, this, this, these. Is all stuff want to try on? No, is stuff I you throw out.  Oh. Seriously, don’t even give to charity, won’t helping anyone. What’s this. Oh, that’s bottled city Kandor.  Uh-huh.  You see, Kandor the capital city the planet Krypton, was miniaturised Brainiac Krypton exploded then rescued Superman.  Oh, nice.  It’s lot cooler girls aren’t looking it. Here, don’t put on I find shirt sport-coat match.  Great, right back. Well, you going, put on.  Here? Oh, you shy?  No, I’m shy. Don’t worry, I won’t look.  I won’t look, would you look, there’s nothing see, well, nothing…. Sweetie, put pants on. Putting on. So, know, isn’t maybe way and could compromise this whole presentation thing. No. No. Scientists not compromise. Our minds trained synthesise facts come inarguable conclusions. Not mention, is batcrap crazy.  What this? Oh, careful. That’s original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit.  Oh, didn’t wear at Halloween? Because it’s costume, it’s a flight suit.  Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, paisley shirt. Uh-huh, goes my corduroy suit.  If mean should end in same place then, I agree. Is your… only tie? Ah. Technically yes, but, you’ll notice, it’s reversible. So works two.  Oh, sweetie, I don’t think even works one. Is all clothes? Yeah. Everything since eighth grade.  The… eighth grade? My last growth spurt.  Okay, well, I guess we’re back the corduroy suit.  Great. Yup. (Leonard picks paisley shirt) I said no, put down.  The ground floor hallway. Hey Sheldon!  Hello Penny.   Get anything good?  Uh, the latest copy Applied Particle Physics Quarterly. Oh, know, is weird yours came mine didn’t. (Sheldon looks confused). It joke. (Sheldon gives a fake laugh.) Yup, tip waitresses, I’m all week.  Penny, to save from awkwardness that I’m perfectly comfortable two us climbing the stairs silence.  Oh yeah, too. Zip it, lock it. (The begin climb) Put in pocket. So and Leonard… Oh dear God!  Little misunderstanding, huh.  A little misunder…. Galileo the Pope a little misunderstanding. Anyway, I talking Leonard morning I think feels bad it.  Huh. Well do feel? I don’t understand question. Well I’m asking it’s difficult be fighting your best friend.  Oh. I hadn’t thought it like that. I wonder I’ve experiencing physiological manifestations some sort unconscious emotional turmoil.  Wait… what?  I couldn’t poop morning.  You just to him, I’m sure guys work out.  It’s certainly preferable my plan. Which was?  A powerful laxative.  Okay, absolutely talk him, look, I Leonard values you as friend, told himself without little idea there’s way he could come with whole experiment thing. Excuse me, little idea?  Yeah, I mean tried explain to me, I didn’t understand but… Of course didn’t, said little idea?  Uh, well no, no, in… in words. In words then, exactly Um, gee, exact words aren’t written… it’s the spirit which it’s  What he say? You a lucky hunch.  Hey, Sheldon, I’ve thinking, instead arguing this don’t…. Don’t ever speak me again.  What… (Sheldon goes apartment slams door).  Uh, he… (makes “he’s screwy” hand movements, turns go).  The apartment. is dressed the corduroy suit.  Okay, I’m leaving the conference.  Have fun presenting lucky hunch.  I didn’t mean like that. Then did say it. I don’t know, I wasn’t choosing my… Were trying impress Penny? No, not all. A little bit.  How’d work for you? Leonard, ready go? Libido 1, truth zero.  Okay, I’m going ask one time, did work together, lets present paper together. And I’m telling for last time it’s pandering, it’s undignified bite me.  Let’s go. Bye Sheldon.  Goodbye Penny. (Places fingers head try make Leonard’s brain explode. leaves.) Oooh, one these days, Pkshhhh! A corridor the conference. is attaching Leonard’s name tag.  There go.  You’re right, side look better.  No, no, I didn’t better, I said less stained.  I checked house, there’s probably twenty, twenty-five people there. You’re kidding.  Is all? All? In particle physics, twenty five Woodstock.  Oh, well, good! I wasn’t expecting crowd, I’m a little nervous.  It’s okay, open a joke, you’ll fine.  A joke. Okay. How this, um, okay, uh there’s farmer, these chickens, they won’t lay eggs. So, he calls physicist help. The physicist does calculations, he says, um, I a solution, it works spherical chickens a vacuum. (Raj Howard laugh.) Right?  Oh, sorry, I’ve just, I’ve heard before.  Let’s roll. Hey, nice suit. It’s classic, right?  I should brought own car.  is presenting. So, conclusion, data show at temperatures approaching absolute zero, moment inertia changes, the solid becomes super-solid, clearly appears be previously unknown state matter. (Applause) Thank you. (Penny asleep Howard’s shoulder. is taking photograph his camera phone.) Are any questions? Yeah. What hell that?  Any questions? Doctor Cooper here, I the lead author this particular paper. (No reaction.) Thank you. And you, sir, have completely skipped the part I walking the park, I saw children a merry-go-round, started thinking the moment inertia gasses like helium temperatures approaching absolute zero.  I didn’t skip it, it’s an anecdote. It’s science. Oh, I see, the apple falling Newton’s head, that an anecdote? You not Isaac Newton. No, that’s true, gravity would been apparent me without apple.  You cannot possibly that arrogant. You continue underestimate me, good man.  Look, weren’t happy my presentation maybe you should given with me. As I explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don’t validation lesser minds. No offence.  Really, why you come? Because I knew you’d screw up. I didn’t screw up. Oh, please. I admit, spherical chicken joke, was hilarious. But was straight downhill there.  I’ve enough your condescension. Maybe I didn’t to college I eleven like you, maybe I got doctorate 24 instead 16, you person is smarter everyone else this room. No offense. And I clearly not the only person is tormented insecurity has ego need constant validation. So admit you’re egotist? Yes. (To audience) My name Dr Hofstadter, I could never please parents I to all self-esteem strangers like you. But he’s worse. Okay, is it. (Tries explode brain again.) You cannot blow my head your mind.  Then I’ll settle an aneurysm.  Stop it. You hit me. You saw him, hit me. You trying blow my head. So was working. It wasn’t, was not, are nutcase. Oh we’ll about (tries again), heads you people the front row, is splash zone. Stop, stop it, quit it. (The start fight.) Is usually these physics things go? More often you’d think. Vulcan nerve pinch! The apartment.  You could offered a ride home.  You’re lucky I didn’t run over.  I don’t understand you’re unhappy about, begged to come, I came, there’s no pleasing you.  You’re right, I’m problem, I’m one needs help.  Well that’s much an apology, I’ll take it.  Excuse me. Is anything you’d like apologise for? Yes. I’m sorry I tried blow your head. It uncalled for.  You won’t believe this. Somebody got whole on cell phone put on youtube.  What?  Now, would that? That would me. Hey, check out, it’s featured video. (The watch).  Oh jeez. Is suit look bad?

No, that’s least our worries. I’ve doing research addiction, the biochemical behavioural aspects, I think there’s problem the current version our lie.  What you talking about, it’s fine, bought it, it’s over.  Sadly, it’s not. Substance abuse a lifelong struggle, beyond I realised the Leo I described would have agreed go rehab. Why not?  Because Leo a middle child.  There no Leo, can say that?  You didn’t read bio, you? He’s just middle child, he’s quintessential middle child, a broken home boot. Psychologically speaking, attention gets rebelling even the point self-destruction more emotionally valuable the help would at rehab. I’ve got solution. Great, is it? Get out. Fine. (He leaves.

You guess one bourgeois parents pushed towards.  Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why? Well, see, Leo would gone rehab, is completely plausible we would have talked into leaving motel, coming home us. Oh…! Sheldon, about as motivation. When I fourteen years old I abused the Philippines a club footed Navy chaplain. No. We’re going middle child, a generic predisposition inadequate serotonin production.

Dennis a highly sought Doctorial candidate we’re hoping to have do graduate here.  Graduate work, impressive. And he’s fifteen years old. Not bad, I started graduate school fourteen. Well, I lost year my family tunnelling of North Korea.  Advantage Kim.  I thought maybe boys could show Dennis around, him why we’re best physics research facility the country. I already you’re not. You don’t an open science grid computer, a free electron laser, the string theory research done is nothing a dead end.  Excuse me, research, it is by means dead end.

He’ll never able cope the fact some fifteen year-old kid smarter more accomplished he is.  Well, if something happen this boy he no longer threat to Sheldon? Then problem would solved.  Hang on, we talking murdering Dennis Kim? I’m saying no.  We don’t to that far, are means available. We can’t send back North Korea. He knows to out.  The thing need do make Kim kid lose focus.

His mother human, father Vulcan, couldn’t conceive. Maybe had go a clinic. Imagine Spock’s dad a little room a copy pointy ears shapely rears. How on Star Trek everybody’s private parts the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, your out my nose.  Hi, you help me, I writing email the A key got stuck. Now it’s going “aaaaaaa”. What you spill it? Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish.  I’ll take look it.  Gentlemen, switching local nerd news. Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair aren’t fielding team the university physics bowl year.  You’re kidding, not? They formed barbershop quartet, got gig playing Knotsbury Farm.  Wow, in world, you’re like, cool guys.  Recognise.  This our year! With guys out, entire physics bowl kneel Zod.  Zod? Kryptonian villain. Long story. Good story. (Clasps hands mouth shock.)  Well count out. What? Why? You me use intelligence a tawdry competition? Would ask Picasso play Pictionary? Would ask Noah Webster play Boggle? Would ask Jacques Cousteau play Go Fish?  Come on, need four person team, we’re four people.  By reasoning should also play bridge, hold a chuppah enter Olympic bobsled competition. I tickets that please.  Sheldon, what, I quote Spock’s dying words to you. No, don’t.  The needs the many. Outweigh needs the few.  Or one. Dammit, I’ll it.  The cafeteria. Okay. First order physics bowl business. We a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions. How perpetual motion squad? It’s beyond laws physics, plus little heads for the ladies.  The ladies? Perpetual motion squad, can all night. I like it. I don’t. Teams traditionally named fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent. Then can the Bengal Tigers. Poor choice. Gram gram, animal exceeds relative fighting strength the army ant.  Maybe so. But can’t incinerate Bengal Tiger a magnifying glass.  Let’s put to vote. All in favour…. Point order. I move any vote team names unanimous. No man be forced emblazon chest the bengal tiger, common sense dictates should be an army ant.  Will gentleman the great state denial yield a question?  I yield. After go the exercise an annoying series votes, of the gentleman lose, he intend threaten quit he not his way? He does.  I move are Army Ants, those favour? The apartment. Good afternoon, welcome today’s physics bowl practice round. I’m Penny, I’ll your host, apparently I didn’t anything else do Saturday afternoon, isn’t just a little sad? Gentlemen, you ready? Yes. Of course.  Fire away. (Raj puts thumb up.) You know, it’s none my business, isn’t guy can’t speak front women going hold back little? Oh, uh, he’ll okay the women mixed the crowd. He has problem they’re one one smell nice. Oh, thanks Raj, it’s vanilla oil. I actually one noticed, okay, let’s start.  Okay, first question on topic optics. What the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper. And course, answer 130 adoseconds. That correct. I knew too. Good you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What the quantum mechanical effect used encode data hard disk drives? Howard. And course, answer giant magneto resistance. Right.  Hey, I buzzed in.  But I answered, it’s called teamwork.  Don’t think I answer engineering questions? I an engineer. By logic I answer the anthropology questions I’m mammal.   Just ask another one. Okay. What artificial satellite seen glimpses Einsteins predicted frame dragging? (Raj buzzes.) And course it’s Gravity Probe B. Sheldon, have let somebody else answer.  Why?  Because it’s polite. What manners with it? This war. Were Romans polite they salted ground Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again? Leonard, said I had ask questions.  The objective the competition to give correct answers, I them, shouldn’t I give them?  Some us might the correct answers too.  Oh please, don’t even a PhD.  Alright, that’s it. Howard, sit down. Okay.  maybe should take little break. Good idea, I wrist brace, this button pushing aggravating my old Nintendo injury.  I agree. What he say?  He compared to disposable feminine cleansing product one might use a summer’s eve.  Yeah, the bag came in.  The same, later. is his laptop. enters. Leonard, excellent, I to show something. Can wait, I to to you. Just look. I’ve designed perfect uniforms our team. The colours based Star Trek, original series. The three you wear support red, I wear command gold.  Why they AA?  Army Ants.  Isn’t confusing? AA might mean something else certain people.  Why would physics bowl team called anodised aluminium? No, I meant…. never mind. Hey, check out. I got a Batman cookie jar! Oh neat, what’s occasion? Well, you’re friend, you like Batman, cookies, you’re the team.  What? Howard, and I had team meeting.  No didn’t. Yes did, I came it. Okay, I don’t where just came from, it couldn’t been team meeting I’m team I wasn’t there, ergo the team not meet.  Okay, me try this way, uh, I at coffee klatch a couple friends one led another it turns you’re the team.  Why? Because you’re taking the fun of it. Well, I’m sorry, winner physics bowl the team has the most fun? Okay, me try this way, you’re annoying no-one wants play you more.  I see. Well. At point I inform I intend form own team destroy molecular bonds that bind very matter together, reduce resulting particulate chaos tears. Thanks the heads up.  You’re welcome. One thing. Yes. It’s on, bitch.  The cafeteria.  So who’d get be his team. He won’t say. He smiles, eats macaroons of bat jar.  He’s using psychological warfare. We must reply kind. I we wait he looks us, laugh like, yes, smart strong competitor, we are also smart strong we a reasonable chance defeating you.  How exactly would laugh go?  Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee! That sounds like, are tall thin woman wants make coat of Dalmatians.  Guys, let’s remember Sheldon still friend my room mate. So? So nothing, let’s destroy him.  Gentlemen. Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee! Okay, we’re going need strong fourth our team. You who’s apparently smart, the girl played TV’s Blossom. She got PhD neuroscience something.  Raj, we’re getting TV’s Blossom join physics bowl team.  How the girl the Wonder Years?  Gentlemen, I believe I’ve found solution all problems.  We can’t ask Leslie Winkle. Why? Because slept together when was done discarded you like last night’s chutney?  Yes.  Sometimes you’ve got take one the team. Yeah. Sack up, dude.  Fine. Here I go, taking one team. In the sack. Hey Leslie. Hi guys. Leslie, I a question you, it might a little awkward, know, given I… Hit thang.  Leonard, there’s reason feel uncomfortable because we’ve seen other’s faces naked bodies contorted the sweet agony coitus.  There’s not? Gee, cos sure sounds like should be.  Rest assured any aspects our sexual relationship regarding preferences, idiosyncrasies, performance, still protected the inherent confidentiality the bedroom. That’s very comforting, if it’s okay, I’d like get with question now. Proceed. We entering physics bowl we a fourth our team. No thanks, I’m busy my like sign dilepton super symmetry search. Dilepton, schmilepton, need you.  Sorry.  Well, tried. Just to face mano-e-mano-e-mano. A-mano.  Wait, you’re going against Cooper?  Yes. That arrogant, misogynistic East-Texas doorknob told I abandon work high energy particles laundry child bearing?  She’s in.  The Physics Bowl. So, do feel? Nice loose? Come play? Got game face on? (The guys confused.) Are ready? Oh, yeah. You you don’t to stay the whole thing.  Oh, no, no, I to. It sounds interesting.  Gentlemen. Sheldon. Sheldon.  Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee. Sheldon. I’m going sit down.  So, that team. Actually, I don’t a team, I could easily defeat single-handedly. But rules require four, may I introduce, third floor janitor, lady the lunchroom, and, Spanish not good, either son her butcher. And about team? What rat you recruited the SS Sinking Ship? Hello, Sheldon.  Leslie Winkle?  Yeah, Leslie Winkle. The answer the question, made Cooper cry like little girl?  Yes, well, I’m polymerised tree sap you’re non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile launch my direction reflected of me, returns its original trajectory, adheres you.  Oh, ouch.  Okay, everyone could please take seats.  Here’s tee-shirt. (Hands a tee-shirt PMS it. Takes jacket to reveal similar.)  PMS? It’s couple days early, but… No, stands Perpetual Motion Squad.  Oh, right, course, was I thinking?  Good afternoon everyone, welcome this year’s physics bowl. Today’s preliminary match features two great teams… AA versus PMS.  All night long, y’all! (Stands turns round reveal back the tee-shirt reads “We Can Go All Night”.) Okay, well let’s jump right in, first question, ten points. What the isospan singlet partner the Pi Zero Meson? (Buzz) PMS? The Eta Meson. Correct.  Formal protest. On grounds? The Velcro my wrist brace caught my shirt. Denied. Alright, ten points, is lightest element earth no stable isotope. (Buzz) AA? And course, answer Technetium. Terrific. Next question, is force two uncharged plates due quantum vacuum fluctuation. (Buzz) PMS? can suck on, Casimir Effect. Correct.  How a quantum computer factor large numbers. (Buzz) PMS? Shor’s Algorithm. Correct.  4.1855 times ten the seventh ergs per calorie. Prevost’s theory exchanges.  Lamda equals one Pi R squared N  760 degrees celsius, approximate temperature the young lady the front row. Mr Wolowitz, is second warning.  A sigma particle. Yes, assuming hypothetical planet a mass greater the earth. Correct. Ladies gentlemen, I hold my hand final question. The score stands AA 1150, PMS 1175. So, one hundred points, match, please turn attention the formula the screens. Solve the equation.  Holy crap.  What hell that. It looks like something found the ship Roswell.  Come on, think, Leslie. Leonard, it’s going work rush me, you have let get there. You’re never going let go, you?  Ten seconds. (Buzz) PMS. Sorry, I panicked.  Then guess. Um, eight. (Gablehouser stares him.) Point four.  I’m sorry, that’s incorrect. AA, you answer correctly, match yours.  He doesn’t it. He’s got squat. AA, I your answer. (Buzz) The answer minus eight alpha.  Hang on, hang a second, that’s our answer. What you doing? Answering question. Winning physics bowl.  How you anything physics? Here I janitor, former Soviet Union I physicist. Leningrad Politechnica. Go Polar Bears.  Well that’s delightful little story, our arrangement that sit and say anything, I answer questions. You didn’t answer question. Hey look, maybe have democracy beloved Russia, on physics bowl team I rule an iron fist. (Makes fist in the air). Ow! AA, I your official answer. Well it’s what said. Then is it?  I a different question. You can’t a different question.  Formal protest. Denied. Informal protest. Denied. I your official answer. No. I decline provide one. Well, that’s bad, the answer teammate gave correct.  That’s opinion. Alright, winner the match is… Hang on. Sheldon, proving you single-handedly smarter everyone else important you would rather lose yourself win part a team.  I don’t understand question.  Go ahead. The winner PMS!  The apartment. goes sit his spot. Sorry, somebody’s sitting there. Who? My Physics Bowl Trophy!  That trophy meaningless, I forfeited, therefore did win.  I someone would disagree. Who? My Physics Bowl Trophy! (In weird voice) “Leonard so smart, who?” Alright is immature. You’re right, I’m sorry. (In voice, waving trophy Sheldon’s face) I’m not!  Okay, new contest.  What you doing? I’m settling and all is smartest around here. Okay, you ready? Absolutely. Bring on. Okay. Marsha, Jan Cindy the three daughters what TV family? (They stare her.) The Brady Bunch. Okay, Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth the lead singer what group? The Brady Bunch?  Van Halen. Alright, Madonna married this Ridgemont High alum. (Pause) Oh God, Sean Penn! How you these things?

No. Formal protest.  Alright, singer sang “Oops I Did It Again.” (Sheldon starts involuntarily twitching again.) Okay, Tweetie Bird, taught taw what? Romulan. Yes. He taught taw Romulan. ",
    "Series 01 Episode 14 – The Nerdvana Annihilation": " The apartment. Well, sandwich an unmitigated disaster. I asked turkey roast beef lettuce swiss wholewheat. What they give you? Turkey roast beef swiss lettuce wholewheat. It’s right ingredients in wrong order. In proper sandwich cheese adjacent the bread create moisture barrier the lettuce. They might well dragged thing a car wash.  I don’t believe it. I know, it’s basic culinary science.  Some auctioning a miniature time machine prop the original film no-one is bidding it.  A time machine the movie The Time Machine?  No, time machine Sophie’s Choice.  Boy, Sophie could used time machine that movie. Did see it, it’s rough.  Oh, that’s cool. Uh-huh. It’s $800? Yeah. And that’s bid. You bid $800. It spur the moment thing, I figured would for thousands I wanted be a part it.  There’s 30 seconds left the auction. Do have $800? Not blow a miniature time machine.  Don’t worry, way things there’s people waiting ‘til last second bid, then swoop and it, it’s called sniping. Fifteen seconds. Come on, snipers.  Ten, nine, eight… Where your snipers? Five. Snipe. Four. Snipe.  Three. Snipe! Two. SNIPE! One. Aaaa-aw!  Congratulations, are proud owner a miniature time machine. You lucky duck.  I wonder no-one else bid, is classic piece sci-fi movie memorabilia.  Yeah, I know, I still can’t afford it.  Why don’t share it? We’ll put two hundred bucks we’ll take turns it our homes. A time share time machine? I’m in. Sheldon? Need ask? But I still don’t understand no-one else bid.  The lobby. The guys stand around full sized time machine.  I understand no-one else bid.  The Did listing actually miniature? I assumed. Who sells full sized time machine $800? In venn diagram, would an individual located within intersection the sets “no longer my time machine” “need $800”. It’s actually tremendous bargain, even shipping works to less four dollars pound.  Cocktain shrimp $12.50. How we going get upstairs?  If take dish it might fit the elevator.  Yes the elevator’s broken two years.  I’ve meaning ask you, you think should a call that?  Not necessary, I masters engineering, I remotely repair satellites a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. When Mars rover started pulling the left I performed a front end alignment 62 million miles away. (Presses lift button. Nothing happens.) No, baby’s broken.  The stairwell, approaching apartment door. and are pulling time machine the last part the stairs. Come on, guys, push.  If I push harder I’m going give birth my colon.  I can’t feel fingers, hurry up.  It’s same amount work matter fast go, basic physics. Sheldon? Yeah.  If fingers ever again, I’ve got job the middle one.  Oh, hey guys. Uh, hi Penny. (Raj Howard heard scream the time machine slides back the stairs.) Take break, guys!  What you doing? Oh, just, know, moving… something upstairs.  What it? It’s… know, time machine.  Yeah, okay, neat, I got get work, so…. Uh, give us few minutes. I don’t a minutes, I’m running late. Then I simple solution, up roof, hop the next building, there’s a small gap, don’t down you’re subject to vertigo, use stairwell.  You’re joking, right? Oh, I never joke it comes vertigo.  Damn, okay, I’ll take roof.  Hey, wait us set the time machine, I drop you off work yesterday. Time travel joke, it’s not… never mind.  For it’s worth, I thought was humorous.  Let’s do this. Guys, ready push? In minute. stepped outside throw up.  The living room. The time machine set up. I don’t what were worried about. I think really works the room. Yeah. It by far coolest I ever owned.  The exact time machine carried actor Rod Taylor Victorian England post-apocalyptic future, society splintered two factions, the sub-terranean Morlocks, survived feasting the flesh the gentle surface dwelling Eloy.  Talk your chick magnets.  Oh yeah. The who lives next me always like, I Jacuzzi my balcony, I a Jacuzzi my balcony. But wait I him, I’ve got a time machine my balcony. Stuff in speedos, Jacuzzi Bob! Gentlemen, I we said we’d take turns, I think you’d agree practicality dictates remain here.  You can’t keep here, if I meet girl say, “you wanna up see time machine, it’s my friends house,” lame that?  He’s got point. Alright, I think we’re going need ground rules, addition the expected shoes the time machine no eating the time machine, I propose we add pants must worn all times the time machine.  Seconded.  I going put a towel.  I still my balcony. I we move it on bi-monthly basis.  That sounds fair. Hold on. Bi-monthly an ambiguous term, you mean move every month, twice month?  Twice month. Then no.  Okay, every month. No.  Sheldon, can’t selfish, all paid it, belongs all us. Now of way I sit my time machine. (Sits turns it on. The three lights front illuminate. All out “oh”.) Okay, I setting the dials March 10th, 1876.  Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents telephone calls for Dr Watson. Wait minute, I’d to that too.  So, it’s turn can. But we go back the point time, Bell’s lab going get crowded, he’ll something’s up.  Also, since time machine doesn’t move space, you’ll end in 1876 Pasadena.  And even make Boston, are you going do, on door say to Mrs Bell, “hey Mrs Bell, big fan your husband, I in watch invent telephone?” Mrs Bell deaf, she’s even going hear knock.  Oh, I solution, first into future obtain a cloaking device. Ooh, far the future? If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk steal cloaking device the Romulans Stardate 5027.3, will January 10th 2328 pre-federation reckoning. Okay, I setting dials January 10th, 2328. Here go future. (Pulls lever, disk begins spin. The guys run around the flat if moving fast motion.) That fun.  My turn. Okay, first all, you call gap nearly three feet wide, I slipped skinned knee. Are okay? Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second all, door stairwell the building locked, I to down the fire escape ends the third floor, forcing to crawl the window a lovely Armenian family, insisted I stay lunch.  That doesn’t sound bad. It eight courses lamb, they tried fix up their son. Sorry. Not done. By time I finally got work, they’d given shift away. Yeah, that’s right, I’ve lost entire day’s pay thanks this… this… Time machine.  The lights flash the dish spins, wanna try it? No! I don’t to try it, God, are grown men, could waste lives these stupid toys costumes comic books and… now that… that… Again, time machine.  Oh please, it’s a time machine, anything looks like something Elton John would drive the Everglades. It moves time. It would worse useless a swamp.  Pathetic. All you, completely pathetic. (Storms out. A beat, then…)  My turn!  Later night, is sitting time machine, turning the lights and off. enters. Leonard, it’s two the morning.  So? So it’s turn. Why you set for day yesterday? Because I to back keep from getting time machine. You can’t. If were prevent from buying past, would available in the present travel back stop from buying it, ergo would still have it. This a classic rookie time travel mistake.  Can I back prevent from explaining to me? Same paradox. If were travel back time and, say, unconscious, would then the conversation irritated you, motivating to back knock me unconscious.  What I knocked unconscious right now?  It won’t change past.  But would the present much nicer.  Are upset something?  What your first clue? Well, was number things. First late hour, demeanour seems low energy, plus your irritability… Yes I’m upset.  Oh! I don’t usually pick on things. Good me.  Yeah, good you.  Oh, wait. Did want talk what’s bothering you?  I don’t know. Maybe. Wow, I’m fire tonight.  Uh, here’s thing. Girls like never end with guys own time machines.  I disagree. Your inability successfully woo long predates acquisition the time machine. That failure clearly stands its own. Thanks pointing out. In addition, premise flawed. In original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux that time machine. In Back Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity hook with extremely attractive young mother.  Those movies. Well course they’re movies. Were expecting to up an example involving real life time machine? That’s absurd.  The stairwell. It previous day, again and are pulling the time machine the stairs. Come on, guys, push.  If I push harder I’m going give birth my colon.  Oh, hey guys. Uh, hi Penny. (Raj Howard heard scream the time machine slides back the stairs.) Take break, guys!  What you doing? Oh, just, know, moving a… time machine.  Yeah, okay, neat, I got get work, so…. No problem. (Removes glasses, pulls out order tape lift doors, forces open.) Hang on. (Takes in arms he holds onto lift cable.) But, about time machine. Some things more important toys. (She puts arms around neck he dangles the cable.) Oh, I’m scared.  Don’t worry baby, I’ve got you. Oh, Leonard. (Kisses as descend view. wakes still sitting the time machine.) It’s still turn. The living room.  What you doing? I’m packing all collectibles taking down the comic book store sell.  Well that necessary. If need money can always sell blood. And semen.  It’s about money. We brought food. Lox bagels, breakfast time travellers. Terrific, anyone to buy share the time machine? Why? Because I don’t it more.  Why? Just… personal reasons.  My spidey-sense tells this something do Penny.  Look, you to buy out not? I’ll give a hundred dollars, will me half owner, we’ll put on balcony.  Screw balcony, I’ll give a hundred twenty we’ll put in garage.  I paid two hundred dollars my share. Dude, everyone knows time machine loses half value minute drive off lot. I’ll for two hundred, time machine stays right it is.  Three hundred, I’ll throw my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon real light speed sound effects.  No, more toys action figures props replicas costumes robots Darth Vader voice changers, I’m getting rid all it.  You can’t that, what you’ve created here, it’s like nerdvana.  More importantly, you’ve Darth Vader voice changer?  Not long. Oh, I call dibs the Golden Age Flash. Hang on, I that complete Justice Society America collection. Too bad, I called dibs. Well can’t call dibs. I and I did, up dibs Wikipedia. Dibs doesn’t apply a bidding war.  It’s a bidding war, I’m selling all Larry at comic book store.  Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?  Will forget dibs!  He offered a fair price the whole collection. What’s number, I’ll match it.  I’ll match it, plus thousand rupees.  What’s exchange rate. None your business. Take or leave it. Mom, bar-mizvah bonds, much I got? Thanks. I go twenty six hundred dollars two trees Israel.  Forget guys, I sell one you, other two going be mad me. Who cares, long you pick me.  Okay, Leonard, put the box, let’s talk. Sorry Raj, mind made up. No. I can’t you this.  Sheldon, out my way. None shall pass.  Okay. I to this but, I here rare mint condition production error Star Trek: The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without visor the original packaging. If do not get of way, I open it.  Okay man, cool, we’re friends here.  What hell’s going on?  You hypocrite! What? Little Miss “grown ups don’t play toys”. If I to into apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are not accumulator Care Bears My Little Ponies? And is Japanese feline I frolicking your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty!  Okay, okay look, this yesterday, Leonard, I really sorry about what I said, I just bit upset. No, I needed hear it. No didn’t. Look, are great guy, it things love make who are.  I guess makes large breasts.  Still, I think it’s time me get rid this stuff and… know… move with life.  Really? Yeah. Oh. Wow. Good you. (Kisses cheek.) Thanks. Hey, you to, I don’t know, later… Excuse me. Hey, Penny! Hi Mike. Are ready go.  Yeah, I have change. I’ll give a hand. Oh, stop it! Bye guys.  My turn the time machine.  A jungle. As camera moves, time machine becomes visible. is sitting it The disk stops spinning, he looks around. The dials read APR 28 802,701.  It worked. It worked. They said I mad, it worked. (Large hairy creatures glowing eyes emerge forest walk towards menacingly.) Oh no, Morlocks! Not flesh-eating Morlocks! He-e-e-e-e-e-e-elp! (With yelp, wakes the time machine in the living room.)  Sheldon, you okay?  We to rid the time machine.  It a little big the living room, isn’t it? Yeah, that’s problem, it’s big.  I’m glad agree. I hired guys help us move it, on fellas. (A pair Morlocks through door.) Oh no, Morlocks? Eat him, eat him. Aaaaargh. (Sheldon wakes in own bed.) Leonard!!!!!!!!",

Oh, alright, is Missy, Missy is Rajesh and you’ve already met Howard.  It’s nice meet you. You too, swell, also. Yeah.  So, do two each other. Oh, once spent nine months my legs wrapped around head.  Excuse me? She’s twin sister, thinks she’s funny frankly I’ve never able see it. It’s you no measurable sense humour, Shelly. How exactly would one measure sense humour? A humourmometer?  Well, I think you’re delightfully droll. Or the French say, Tres Drole.  Okay, let see I got this. Leonard, and… I’m sorry was name again.

Although I have live a little the future, ’cause, well, that’s job. Of course, fondness classic science fiction draw attention backwards, those stories often take place the future. In conclusion, no, doesn’t bother me. Okay, well, that’s cool you. Yeah, well I wouldn’t cool, I’d say, that’s Leonard! Well, In case, you mind giving some advice? About Stuart? Love to. He’s shy, do I him feel comfortable around me? Well, uh, first all, don’t underestimate value discomfort. Really? Well, yeah, thrives pressure, that’s he works a comic book store.

Yeah, ha, it’s hilarious. Now, here’s approximation spare parts available Space Station. We gotta find way, using nothing this, reinforce so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine. You mean it doesn’t hit fan? Yeah, I to say, I thought toilet humour would less funny repetition. Apparently, law diminishing comedic returns space poop. (There is a on door) Hey Leonard. Hey Stuart. You busy? Um… Classified, Leonard. Yeah, it’s regular Manhattan Project. What’s up? Well, tonight’s date Penny since haven’t able connect phone… Yeah, I’m sorry, it’s broken. Or e-mail. Yeah, too.

No, was pretty clear wanting keep options open. I something announce, out respect convention, I wait you finish current conversation. What you talking about? The cultural paradigm which people sex three dates. I see. Now, we talking date, social interaction, date, dried fruit? Never mind, what’s announcement? Oh, good, turn. Well, is exciting I wanted among first to know… Hey, Cooper, I hear you’re going be the wadio Ira Fwatow Science Fwiday next week. Thank you, Kripke, depriving of opportunity share news my friends. My pweasure. My thank was sincere. But pweasure is. Let ask a question, what point National Public Wadio to start scwaping bottom the bawwel its guests? Eh, don’t answer, it’s wetowical. Why a stupid head? That also rhetorical. I’m sorry you had hear that. Are really going be NPR? Yes, they’re interviewing by phone my office, regarding recent so-called discovery magnetic monopoles spin-ices. It’s pledge week they’re trying goose ratings a little controversy. Very cool, congratulations. Thank you. My mother very excited. She’s convening Bible study group listen in, then pray my soul. I on radio once. I called Fever 104 FM New Delhi was fourth person to say phrase pays, “Fever 104, आज के नये अच्छे संगीत का घर.” That means: “Fever 104, home the good current music.” It’s much catchier Hindi. The apartment. All right. These the talking points my NPR interview tomorrow. I sure they’re simple enough the less educated the audience understand. Howard, this and me what’s unclear to you. Excuse me, I a master’s degree engineering Massachusetts Institute Technology. It required the completion 144 units grad and original thesis. Yes. Look over tell what’s unclear you. You know, Sheldon gives homework, don’t to it. In fact, it’s better you don’t, otherwise makes rest us bad. Hi, guys. Hey. Hello. Yo, Raj, to me. I’m sorry, screwing you. Hey, Howard, haven’t called Bernadette? Did say something? Yeah, said hasn’t heard a week. I thought you liked her? I do, yeah, she wants commitment I’m sure she’s type. She agreed go with for free. What do need? Look, is nice. I always thought I finally settle into relationship, would with someone, know, different. Different how? Well, know, like Megan Fox Transformers, Katee Sackhoff Battlestar Galactica. Are high? You’d a better shot the three-breasted Martian hooker Total Recall. Okay, you’re being unrealistic. Anyway, movie like 20 years ago, imagine saggy things would be. Howard, you’re going throw away great girl like because you’re holding for ridiculous fantasy? Hey, because settled doesn’t mean I to. Excuse me, I’m sitting here. Hey, I not settle Leonard. I mean, obviously, isn’t kind guy I usually out with, know, physically. Again, I’m right here. My point is, I not judge book its cover. I interested the person underneath. I here, right? You me. Hey, I’m interested what’s inside people, too, why it wrong want insides wrapped in, say, delicious caramel is Halle Berry? (To Raj) Yes, you’re delicious caramel, too. All right, know what, I tell why it’s wrong… Excuse me, may I interject? What? Biologically speaking, is perfectly justified seeking the optimum mate the propagation his genetic line. Thank you, Sheldon. Now, whether propagation in interest humanity is, course, entirely different question. Kripke in storage cupboard some kind. He tubes rigged through roof attached helium tanks he turning on. The radio playing.  This Ira Flatow you’re listening NPR’s Science Friday. Joining us today phone his office Pasadena, California Dr. Cooper. Oh, is going be wiot. Thanks being us today, Dr. Cooper. My pleasure, Ira. Now, let’s about magnetic monopoles. Can explain our audience what monopole is? Of course. First, consider ordinary magnet has, (the pitch his voice begins rise) even most uneducated your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) north south pole. If cut in half, have two smaller magnets, with own north south pole. Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think might something wrong our connection. No, I hear fine. As I saying, ordinary magnet two poles. The primary characteristic a monopole that has one pole, hence, monopole. A requirement string theory, M-theory, you will, existence such monopoles. I, myself, led expedition the Arctic Circle search said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I’m going kill you! Howard’s bathroom. He in bath. So nice could join this evening.

Good. However, an unrelated topic, I never getting of bed again. What could Kripke even sillier he made you look? I don’t think that’s possible, dude. You’re helping. I didn’t help, I came to mock. Sheldon, you is figure a way to exact vengeance Kripke, like, uh, like, Joker got back Batman putting in the Arkham Asylum the Criminally Insane. That’s true. He didn’t stay and about feelings the psychotic villains. He, broke and poisoned Gotham’s water supply. Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke. No, no. It’s simple matter. There several toxic chemicals that’d untraceable an autopsy. Okay, uh, that’s spirit, but, um, let’s dial back a non-lethal form vengeance. Oh! How we put awhoopee cushion his office chair?

So, Leonard, says you’re working fundamental tests quantum mechanics. I am. Are interested physics? Oh, I find fascinating. If I hadn’t gone microbiology, I probably would gone physics. Or ice dancing. Actually, tests Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect reached interesting point. Right now, we’re testing the phase shift due an electric potential. That’s amazing. Yes.

Ready get started? One moment. Subject appears well-rested enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance bliss. All right, us begin. Where’s notebook? Um, I don’t one. How you going take notes without notebook? I to take notes? How else you gonna study the tests? There’s gonna a test? Tests. Here. It’s college-ruled. I hope that’s too intimidating. Thank you. You’re welcome. Now, Introduction Physics. What physics? Physics comes ancient Greek word physika. It’s this point you’ll to start taking notes. Physika means the science natural things.

Howard, you something Leonard me? Uh, do mean? He says I see experiment tomorrow might weird out. Really? He said that? You’re jealous Leonard, you? Me? No. I may mentioned it’s little inappropriate be asking another man’s girlfriend his experiment without first discussing with said man. Are saying I ask permission to hang with Leonard? I didn’t anything like that. I said has ask permission. (Bernadette storms out) Come on, I don’t to eat lamb stew my mother. Damn, I this close the bra. The apartment. Now, remember, Newton realized Aristotle wrong force not necessary maintain motion. So let’s plug our 9.8 meters per second squared A force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can that MA equals MG what we from this? Uh, know that… Newton a smart cookie. Oh! Is where Fig Newtons from? No, Fig Newtons named a small town Massachusetts. Don’t write down! Sorry. Now, MA equals MG does imply? I don’t know. How know? I told you. Have you suffered recent blow the head? Hey! You don’t to so mean! I’m sorry. (Smiling) Have suffered recent blow the head? No, just suck teaching. Really? Of two explanations, one seems most likely? Oh, God, Sheldon, I’m trying understand, you’re going fast. Can just back a little bit? All right. It’s warm summer evening ancient Greece… Not far back! Okay! At point you begin feel lost? I don’t know. Where we looking at night sky? Greece. Damn it! There’s need get frustrated, people learn different rates. Unlike objects falling a vacuum, which…? MA equals MG? Squared? No. Aristotle? No. Five? Oh! Then I don’t know. Why you crying? Because I’m stupid! That’s reason cry. One cries one sad. For example, I cry others stupid it makes sad. Okay, look, we please forget all extra stuff can just me Leonard does? All right. is attempting learn sub-atomic particles move way do. Really? That’s it? Well, doesn’t sound complicated. It’s not. That’s Leonard it. Okay, I have one question. What exactly sub-atomic particles? A good question. Thank you. And answer it, first must ask ourselves, is physics? Oh, balls. It’s warm summer evening ancient Greece… Leonard’s lab. Okay, I got bone pick you. What I now? I in bed Bernadette, you text-blocked me. What? We completely naked, to devour other when, text that I a problem her hanging with you. You have problem her hanging with me. Yeah, that’s what tell her. What I supposed tell her? I don’t know, something doesn’t me off a petty, jealous douche. And would be? Come on, I to think everything? Hey, Leonard. Am I late see experiment? Oh, hi. Hi. What you here? Same you’re here. I came see Leonard’s experiment. No, didn’t. You said Leonard’s experiment stupid. You told my experiment stupid? I just repeating Sheldon said. Let’s get topic, Bernadette, I apologize. I wrong to tell who should friends with. Should I, um, leave two alone? No, Leonard, should hear this. Okay, good, ’cause I wasn’t gonna go. Look, I I off confident worldly, the truth I’m not. We’re shocked. Which why I tend feel threatened other guys. Or loud noises, clowns nuns. But I realize foolish is. He a panic attack when got head stuck a sweater. It a full turtleneck. Why aren’t helping me? I don’t know. Maybe I’m crazy? Bernadette, please, I’m asking to give another chance. What you think, Leonard? Should I give another chance? It’s to you. He didn’t call experiment stupid. Come here, tushy face. Tushy face, is going Twitter right now. The apartment.  Raj, should’ve seen Leonard’s experiment. The interference pattern so cool the electron beam on. I’m glad enjoyed it. Most people aren’t interested what I do. Actually, that’s true, Leonard. In fact, recently I’ve thinking given parameters your experiment, transport electrons aperture nano-fabricated metal rings qualitatively different experiment already conducted the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That’s it. That’s I know. Oh, wait! Fig Newtons named a town Massachusetts, the scientist.",

Doesn’t matter finger. Good choice. Now move down your e-mail icon. Yeah, the little envelope. What mean, does look like? It looks like envelope! Fine, you don’t like the computer, don’t use it! Sure, can exchange it for salad spinner. Good-bye! That’s Hanukkah present you’re regretting, huh? I won’t that senior citizens can’t master technology be publicly flogged, if made example one two, might give others incentive try harder. I a great idea. You how we’re always to stop solve differential equations, like you’re Fourier analysis, using Schrodinger equation? doesn’t. He’s an engineer. I thinking, could write little app would use handwriting recognition, then run through symbolic evaluation engine. You use smartphone, take picture the equation bam! You what’s great app? The one makes fart noises. You know, Leonard, that’s actually valid idea. Very good. Can say and make sound like I’m cat learned to use toilet? No. The two achievements equally surprising equally admirable, though pressed, I’d give slight edge the cat. I’ll save the pain nervousness waiting the answer. I agree to be part your project. Congratulations. Oh, yay me. What you guys? I can’t promise anything, people make money stuff like this. A extra bucks would nice. I could finally move of mother’s house. Where would go? I always dreamed building little place my over garage. You know, I made money, I could take time from and give pretty girls submarine rides. What’s that? Some weird sex thing? No. You take pretty girls underwater your private submarine, you show fish. Why everything to dirty you? I thinking could on at night, then maybe a couple weeks, we’ll ourselves app sell. Sounds like we’re business. I think should take picture capture moment. Yeah. Oh! Was the best 99 cents I ever spent, what? The apartment.  I checked App Store. No one doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving. Oh, dear Lord, shush. What? You so good ideas, Leonard. And you’re going spill beans front an outsider? Who, me? Sheldon, I don’t think cares handwriting-recognition based differential… The stars night big bright, deep the heart Texas. She’s going steal idea. What idea? We’re gonna write application… The prairie sky wide high, deep the heart… Okay, stop, stop! Of Texas. Whatever secret is, I’m sure it’s boring, I’m interested. It’s boring all. You see, higher order mathematics, are certain sets equations that… Bored. Satisfied? Hardly. Consider unlikely very plausible scenario. A young woman alone the big city. Her ridiculous dream becoming actress lies shattered her. Hey, wait minute. Well, hang on. Let’s where he’s going. Then hits her. How going survive? I mean, has prospects, marketable skills. And one day, she meets group geniuses their friend Howard. Hey, I… Hang on. Let’s where he’s going. She befriends them, then lies wait they reveal marketable idea, she steals sells the highest bidder. That ridiculous. Oh, it? Well let’s you up an explanation to this woman hangs with us the time. Oh, great. You what? I’ve already mooched dinner you guys. I don’t listen to this. There’s answer, free food. All right, I’ve taken liberty drafting workflow charts outline various duties the path will follow we develop ground-breaking new app. Hey, am I charge phone support? Seems bit racist. A customer service representative an Indian accent create impression we’re vast enterprise uses overseas call centres. Oh. Very clever. But still racist. Duly noted, Steve Wichita. Why I listed your executive assistant? Because word secretary fallen disrepute. FYI, mother’s birthday coming up. I’m going need to pick a present. Okay, need stop a minute. Leonard, please, can during break. We one coming at midnight. We’ll snacks. Sheldon, you’re charge. It’s idea. I’m in charge. Oh, course are. Look the organizational chart. You’re clearly listed founder. Well, yes, you’re listed Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer Chief Operating Officer. You missed Chief Science Officer, Chairman the Board, Head the Secret Santa Committee. Okay. You to clear this right now. I in charge this project. Ooh. Leonard’s going alpha nerd Sheldon’s ass. All right. All right, I’m going argue you. Cooper nothing not team player. Dr. Hofstadter, have conn. Thank you. I thought might start talking the user interface. Oh, dear Lord, we’re doomed. Later.  So button will allow to scan new equation, over here, can press this, just substitute new values the coefficients. Good one, boss. What? This diagram. I assume were opening a joke. It certainly buoyed this employee’s esprit de corps. It’s a joke. It’s real design. In case, may I offer 27 little tweaks make slightly less embarrassing? Sheldon, I think will work. Let’s try my way. Oh, I’m, I’m sorry. I assumed wanted candid truth-telling your employees, I realize now, you want mindless nattering complacent yes-men. Are done? If say so, boss. Later still. So right now, button-press event just triggering dummy procedure call… How this the app name? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized Numerator. So spells Sheldon? Does it? A happy accident. We’re doing names now. Howard? Like I saying, right it’s a dummy procedure, eventually, will drop us into… All right, fine. If we’re going give a name, we least give a secret code designation? No. Well, hear out. The atomic bomb The Manhattan Project. Windows 95 originally Project Chicago. For app, I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs. That’s Sheldon backwards. Another happy accident. We’re wasting time names right now. I see. Is decision open discussion? No. Is decision not discuss open discussion? No. Again, right it’s a dummy procedure, eventually, will drop us into… I call a vote no confidence an immediate change leadership. Oh Sheldon, stop it. When course human events, becomes necessary dissolve the bonds tie three competent scientists together… That’s enough, Sheldon. All right, let’s right the vote. Show hands those opposed Leonard his reign tyranny. Okay, that’s it, you’re fired. Really? Why? Because you’re impossible work with. I see. And that open discussion? The following morning. What you doing? Oh. Good morning, shoemaker. I think you’ll pleased what elves up last night. But I fired you. Oh, I know. I’m an independent contractor. No, are nothing. You no connection this project whatsoever. But I made better. I don’t it better. I it way. Well, speaks volumes, doesn’t it? All right, I suppose I’ll put my bus pants. What hell bus pants? They pants one wears one’s regular pants one sits bus seats other people previously sat on. But perhaps your lofty heights atop corporate ladder, you’ve lost touch the struggles the common man.

How goes little project? You mean, Project Lenwoloppali? Ah, combination all names. Very clever. I assume Koothranardowitz taken? We’re actually scanning equations getting good results. Oh, well then, all means, carry on. I wouldn’t to impede progress. Howard, you solve install time problem yet? No. It’s little tricky. I’m gonna try it pick the libraries dynam… What you doing?! Playing theremin. No. I mean, are doing a theremin? Playing it. I’ve loved theremin first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And it’s killing that just sits my closet, gathering dust.

Glory, hallelujah. Something got down, there, Sheldon? kicked out my apartment. And app team. Oh, honey, I’m sorry. He wouldn’t drive to today. I to wear bus pants. Is so? Yes. And they’re still sticky. Aw. Probably going have throw away. Hey, don’t Leonard his app. You make one me. With you? Seriously, I a great idea one. Is better your idea move Los Angeles become famous actress? Okay, look, someone wearing shoes like, just snap picture them, the app goes the Internet find where you can buy them. That’s app idea? Well, don’t like it? I didn’t that. But no, I don’t. Why not? Oh, Penny, do I begin? The simple-mindedness your idea exceeded by crass consumerism banality. And didn’t to with you? Imagine that.

Okay, so, wasn’t 21st birthday Biff will placed first bet made his millions. That’s he altered timeline. Yeah, he will haven’t placed it! What? Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, couldn’t more simple. When Biff gets almanac 1955, alternate future creates isn’t one which Marty Doc Brown ever use time machine travel 2015. Therefore, new timeline, Marty Doc never brought the time machine… Wait. Is brought right? Marty Doc never have brought? I don’t know. You it me. Oh, I’m going it. Marty Doc never brought time machine 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also have had brought almanac 1955 Biff. Therefore, timeline which 1955 Biff gets almanac also timeline which 1955 Biff never gets almanac. And just never gets.

We didn’t to, was clearly tangent. Now on. Back work. If we’re leaning towards quantum coupling… Aah! Why? You said quantum coupling. That made think the show Quantum Leap. That’s tangent it’s fault.

Okay, well, cool. Uh, there’s thing called superfluid vacuum theory, empty space is imagined a superfluid all its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension… Hey, you’re pausing dramatic effect, I’d keep moving. No, no. People don’t about surface tension. If imagine three-space the surface an N-dimensional superfluid bubble… This exciting. This really exciting. I to find Sheldon. Okay, well, you find him, use kitchen island, coffee table not support of you. The apartment. Which means spherical multidimensional superfluid shows same negative-energy density space-time.

Going smaller would require weeks’ worth new computations.  So the kid the two shirts do it. Sir, uh, I may, uh, we’ve put lot thought effort this current prototype.
